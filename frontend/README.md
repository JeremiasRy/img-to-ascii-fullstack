# Frontend to gather image data and display ASCII art

The logic with this frontend is that it first checks the size of the screen the use is using. Then it saves that as expected output dimension. <br/> Then forwards that information to backend with the picture. So please run the app full screen! Some very basic CSS was implemented.

## Techs 
- React 
- Typescript
- CSS
- Axios

## To run

run `npm install` on the root of this folder then `npm start`, remember to run the app full screen for best results! If the app opened in a smaller window change it to full screen and press f5. This adjusts the output dimensions.
